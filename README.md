# Short description
This is a geography game where you get the chance to guess the correct country. Each qustion about the country gives 4 chances of varying difficulty to get it right. It goes from hard to easier. First chance is the countries calling code, second chance is the countries currency, third chance is the geographical represantation of the country in a 2D map, and finally the easiest question the flag of the country. Each failed chance reduces the points by 20 points. If you manage to get the first question right that's a 100 points, the second 80 points, third 60 points etc.
